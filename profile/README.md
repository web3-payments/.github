## Web3 Interoperable Payments Infrastructure

:zap: Built and open sourced by the Crosspay team 

## What is Crosspay
**Welcome to the world of web3 payments üåç**

Crosspay is the world‚Äôs first web3 interoperable payments infrastructure. Providing end-to-end payment solutions from payment links, subscriptions, tip jars, invoicing, auditing and much more.
We aim to make the web3 payments journey as seamless as possible allowing merchants to choose any token they wish to receive and customers to pay in the token of their choice. We take care of the hard work.

## What's the problem?
Onboarding new individuals into the world of web3 is already extremely challenging and in most cases lead to cryptocurrency sitting in a CEX as purely an investment vehicle. We want to bring further utility to these tokens by allowing merchants to set up shop and customers to spend their stagnant investments in the same way they would with fiat currency except with much lower fees and no exchange rate issues.

Current web3 payment solutions have a really poor UX, high fees or a complicated pricing model and have very limited functionality. Most developers create a bespoke payment gateway for their platforms without auditing their contracts which carries a significant risk to both them and their customers. This does nothing but harm mass adoption further.

## How we solve it.
We aim to provide an end-to-end payments infrastructure meaning we fulfil the needs across the entire customer journey and provide a seamless experience to all stakeholders.
We are interoperable by default meaning we are chain agnostic and allow merchants to choose the token of their choice to receive crypto in and customers to pay with the crypto currency the choose to. No complicated exchanges required by users.
We charge one flat fee of 1% for all transactions made through Crosspay meaning we have no complicated pricing mechanisms.
We are web3 native meaning all you need to do to access our tools is connect with your wallet.
We provide a sleek UX and bulletproof audited contracts meaning your payments journey is stress free and comparative to leading web2 payment provider experience.
